This project is an Arduino-based automated turret that tracks and shoots projectiles using an 
airsoft pistol. The system features a graphical user interface (GUI) that records every movement 
of a person in front of the camera. The turret continuously tracks the person, 
and if they move closer, it automatically fires.
